# GANs Project: Generate Faces
## Deep Learning Nanodegree Udacity (with Pytorch)

### Project Overview

In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces using the processed CelebA face data.

The project includes:
- loading the data
- Defining the Model (Generator and Discriminator)
- Creating Generator and Discriminator losses
- Choosing the appropriate optimizers and hyperparameters
- Training the Model
